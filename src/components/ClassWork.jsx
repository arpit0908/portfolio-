        <div className=''>

          "The world is your Oyster.It is upto you to find your pearls"

          The reason why I liked this dialouge is because it is relatable in a number of ways.Everyone can be successfull in their life and acheive their dream we might have to deal with hardships,failures and sadness in our journey to reach our goal but if we don't stop trying one day we will surely get the result of our efforts.We are responsible for our actions the decisions that we make and these decisions and choices lead us to what we end up achieving.Everything that we do has an impact on our future.

            I don't usually watch this kind of movie but it definately made a place in my heart.It taught me about how you look at things can change your life.In todays time when we get stressed out by even the little things that we can't figure out this movie delivered a story to it's audience which inspired them to change their perspective of dealing with problems and being gratefull for what we have.When you watch this movie you relate it with yourself, the efforts our parents make to provide us with the best that they could and how they never show their sadness to us no matter what problems they are facing.

            Always have a positive approach towards every situation that you face. No  matter how bad things turn out we should never give up on the things and people we love.

            Finding happiness in the little things of our life is important and we should be grateful for what we have. We might have to face some extremly bad conditions in our life but we should be prepared mentally to overcome that situation and move forward and make our best efforts to make situation better for us and our loves ones.
